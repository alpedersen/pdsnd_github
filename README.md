### Project Title
Bikeshare Analysis Program

### Description
The Bikeshare analysis program takes in data from New York City, Chicago, and Washington. The user is then requested to filter the data to their
desired city, weekday, and month. Once the filters are complete, the user gets a report of useful statistics such as most frequent time, most
popular start spot, and most frequent user of a bike. There is also an option to look through the raw data.

### Files used
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv
