### Description
The Bikeshare analysis program takes in data from New York City, Chicago, and Washington. The user is then requested to filter the data to their desired city, weekday, and month. Once the filters are complete, the user gets a report of useful statistics such as most frequent time, most popular start spot, and most frequent user of a bike. There is also an option to look through the raw data.
